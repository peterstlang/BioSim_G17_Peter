   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to BioSim's documentation!
==================================

This is a simple simulation of an ecosystem, called Rossumisland!
 * Two species of animals, Herbivores and Carnivores
 * Four different landscape types, Water, Desert, Lowland and Highland
 * An island which consists of the different landscapes populated by the animals
 * Also includes simple visualization!

The main interface is found in the simulation module. When you run the
program it will show you the island, the distribution of the different
species as a heatmap and how many animals there are each year.

It is also possible to change the map, the different parameters and
for how long you would like to run the simulation
